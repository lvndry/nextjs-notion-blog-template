## API Endpoints

The application includes the following API routes:

- `GET /api/notion/pages?action=list` - Get all accessible pages
- `GET /api/notion/pages?action=content&pageId=<id>` - Get page content
- `GET /api/notion/pages?action=details&pageId=<id>` - Get page details

## Supported Block Types

The application can display content from various Notion block types:

- Paragraphs
- Headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Bulleted lists
- Numbered lists
- To-do items
- Code blocks
- Quotes
- Dividers
- And more with graceful fallbacks for unsupported types

## Navigation

- **Main Page (`/`)**: View all your Notion pages in a list format
- **Individual Page (`/page/[pageId]`)**: View the full content of a specific page
- **Click on page titles** to navigate to the detailed view
- **Use the "Back to Pages" link** to return to the main list

## UUID Format Handling

The application automatically handles different UUID formats:

- **Notion URLs**: `5d0afad8277a4ffa8eea4820700ee069` (32 characters, no hyphens)
- **Standard UUIDs**: `5d0afad8-277a-4ffa-8eea-4820700ee069` (36 characters with hyphens)
- **Automatic Conversion**: The app converts between formats as needed for API calls and URLs

## Troubleshooting

### "NOTION_TOKEN environment variable is not set"

- Make sure you've created a `.env.local` file
- Verify the token is correctly set in the file
- Restart your development server

### "No pages found"

- Ensure your integration has been shared with the pages you want to view
- Check that the integration has the correct permissions
- Try refreshing the page

### Pages not loading

- Check that the integration hasn't been revoked
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
